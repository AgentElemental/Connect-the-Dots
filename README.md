# Connect-the-Dots
"Dots and Boxes" is a strategic pencil-and-paper game for
two players, popularised by the French mathematician
Ã‰douard Lucas. The game involves connecting dots to form
boxes on a grid. Players take turns drawing lines between
two adjacent dots, intending to complete the fourth side of
a 1x1 box. The player who completes the most boxes wins.
This project aims to develop a digital version of the "Dots
and Boxes" game, enhancing user experience through
interactive features and strategic elements.
